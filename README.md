# no-circles-allowed
Game inspired by Flappy Bird in which you control gravity.

Created for the Finally Finish Something game jam 2021.

The Windows build submitted can be found here:
[NO CIRCLES ALLOWED](https://franchocratico.itch.io/no-circles-allowed)

Tested on Unity 2019.4.40f1 version.

## How to play
Here are some instructions on how to play the game:
 - Up and down arrows or right and left click make you "flap" upwards and downwards respectively.
 - Touching the ceiling or ground, as well as the circle obstacles will make you loose lives, the hearts replenish them.
 - If you "flap" on the same direction for too many times in a row you'll spin too fast and become a circle, loosing a life.
 - To restart just hit 'R'.
 - The goal is to reach the highest score possible.

#### Good luck! :)
